## About The Project

This is a simple app I made for personal use to select a random a team from my Pokemon Showdown teams when playing with friends. I'm putting it here both because it'll make it easier to distribute to my friends and because why not


### Built With
C# in Windows Forms

## Getting Started
Simply cloning the repo should be good enough to work. It does use Advanced Installer to create the setup file, though that is not at all needed to work on the code or use the app. Yes, the api key for random.org is in the files, pls don't steal it
